    <reviewtitle>How to Play</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Press "1" to confirm/start and "p" to pause.

"Ctrl and alt" rotates the pieces.
"Arrow keys" moves the pieces and will also used to select things in the menu.

I like to press "tab" and change the controls so instead of "ctrl and alt" it is "z and x".</reviewbody>
